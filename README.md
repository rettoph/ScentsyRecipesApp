## Objective
Build a simple web application which lets users create edit and delete recipes and related data. The app must be a C# MVC Dotnet Core 3.1 application built in Visual Studio 2019. **Do not** use Entity Framework. The data access portion of the app should be built with [ADO.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ado-net-overview). 

When completed, close Visual Studio, zip the entire solution directory and email to your Scentsy recruiter. The interview team will test your project by running the SQL scripts to set up the database and then running the app from visual studio.

Fulfill the following user stories using whichever library or APIs you need:

-   **User Story:** I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
-   **User Story:** I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
-   **User Story:** I can click into any of those recipes to view details about the recipe.
-   **User Story:** I can edit the recipes’ information and ingredients.
-   **User Story:** I can delete the recipes.
